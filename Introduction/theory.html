who is the CSS inventor?

The invention of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is credited to Håkon Wium Lie, a Norwegian web pioneer. In October 1994, while working at CERN alongside Tim Berners-Lee, Lie proposed CSS as a solution to separate content from presentation on the web. This separation allowed for more flexible and maintainable web design by enabling multiple style sheets to influence the presentation of a document through a cascading mechanism.

Lie's proposal was presented at the "Mosaic and the Web" conference in Chicago in 1994. Subsequently, he collaborated with Bert Bos, who had been developing his own style sheet language called the Stream-based Style Sheet Proposal (SSP). Together, they refined the CSS specification, leading to the publication of CSS Level 1 as a W3C Recommendation in December 1996.
